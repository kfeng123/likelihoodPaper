We provide general conditions for obtaining optimal risk bounds for point estimates acquired from mean-field variational Bayesian inference. The conditions pertain to the existence of certain test functions for the distance metric on the parameter space and minimal assumptions on the prior.  A general recipe for verification of the conditions is outlined which is  broadly applicable to existing Bayesian models with or without latent variables. As illustrations,  specific applications to Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Gaussian mixture models are discussed. },
